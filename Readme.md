Please open this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1utnQNlehtmGiB14Q9nHqqooHqzsq59aK7y0LmdOdQQI/edit)
for instructions on what to do. 

songs/ contains a subset of songs from the SoundSafari Repository which we want to organize according 
to the Artist name into subfolders.

./organize.sh script will organize the songs into organized_songs subfolder according to the Artist name.

If you want to pull more songs, add the name of the song from list_of_songs.txt to list_of_songs_subset.txt 
and run the ./pull_songs.sh script.
