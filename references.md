Hi Matthew,

  Is there any exercise that you are planning around teaching Linux environment? If so, I would like to be part of it.

  Otherwise, I can help design such an exercise around teaching how to use Linux terminal.
  basic introduction to terminal - (an idea that it's a textbook that is alive and responds to you)

    programs 
    basics of bash

  some rudimentary exercise in bash scripting or doing stuff on terminal

Thanks,
Abdul
